My Explanation to Granny!

"Machine Learning is the salt which you can add to all recipes". Machine Learning algorithms is used in almost all software products. 
Machine learning is about extracting knowledge from data. It is a research field at the
intersection of statistics, artificial intelligence and computer science, which is also
known as predictive analytics or statistical learning. The application of machine
learning methods has in recent years become ubiquitous in everyday life. From automatic
recommendations of which movies to watch, to what food to order or which
products to buy, to personalized online radio and recognizing your friends in your
photos, many modern websites and devices have machine learning algorithms at their
core. When you look at at complex websites like Facebook, Amazon or Netflix, it is very
likely that every part of the website you are looking at contains multiple machine
learning models.Outside of commercial applications, machine learning has had a tremendous influence
on the way data driven research is done today. The ML tools 
have been applied to diverse scientific questions such as understanding stars, finding
distant planets, analyzing DNA sequences, and providing personalized cancer treatments.
Your application doesnâ€™t need to be as large-scale or world-changing as these examples
in order to benefit from machine learning.
